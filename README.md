# My Personal Project : Formula 1 Fantasy

This application is essentially a fantasy sport game where users can create teams and select drivers to add to their team.
Users are allowed to make as much teams as they would like.

Features of this application include allowing users to view a _created team_, its _selected drivers_,
the _driver's statistics_, and _load existing data_ of a previously created team.

Growing up I find myself interested in playing video games. I used to spend hours everyday playing
games in my PC. As I get older, I think about how the games I play are made, wondering upon the millions of code lines that
are written "behind the scene".
Recently, I've found myself watching and keeping up with Formula 1 Racing. Despite people asking me,
_"What's so fun watching people drive around in circles?"_ I really enjoy the sport and every race weekend excites me 
as I hear the V6 engines of the fastest cars ever built. 

I have decided for this project that I would like to combine these
two interests of mine and make a fantasy application for Formula 1.
This application won't be as complex and sophisticated as the games I've enjoyed playing in the past (Minecraft, Fortnite, Valorant, etc),
but I like to think of this personal project as baby steps to who knows? perhaps a possible future as a game developer.
